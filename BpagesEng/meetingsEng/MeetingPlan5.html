<h1>MEETING      2/6/2021                                        </h1>

  <pre>
    As an American, I will do my best to –
      Be clean in my outdoor manners.

      Be considerate in the outdoors.

  </pre>

<div>2a. Describe how the scouts in the troop provide its leadership</div>
<div>Ex: SPL keeps scouts under control during meetings, and gives tasks to others to do before meetings to make sure it runs smoothly.</div>
<div>2b. Describe the four steps of Boy Scout advancement.</div>
<div><pre>Step 1: The Scout learns. They learns Scouting skills by taking an active, hands-on part in troop and patrol meetings and outdoor programs. this learning, as we said above, is the natural outcome of their regular Scouting activities — their “on-the-job” training.
  Step 2: The Scout is tested. When their leaders see that the Scout has mastered a given skill and satisfied a given requirement, they tell them so — and record the achievement.
  Step 3: The Scout is reviewed. When a Scout completes all requirements for a rank, they appear before a “board of review” composed of members of the troop committee. Their purpose is not to retest the Scout, but to make sure the Scout has met all the requirements, to chat with the Scout about how they feel they are getting along with the troop and its program, and of course to encourage them to keep advancing.
  Step 4: The Scout is recognized. When a Scout is certified by the Board of Review, they are awarded the new badge of rank as soon as possible, normally in a ceremony at the next troop meeting. The Scout should be recognized again at the troop’s next court of honor.</pre></div>
<div>2c. Describe what the Boy Scout ranks are and how they are earned.</div>
