<h2>FIRST AID</h2>

<div>SMALL CUTS AND SCRAPES</div>

<p1>Wash scrapes and minor cuts with soap and water. Ask about any allergies, if none, apply triple antibiotic ointment and cover with a dry, sterile dressing or an adhesive bandage to help prevent infection and protect the wound. Clean and rebandage wounds each day or more often as needed.</p1>

<div>BLISTERS ON THE HAND AND FOOT</div>

<p2>Prevent: wear shoes or boots that fit and are broken in. Change socks if they become sweaty or wet. Wear work gloves when working with your hands outdoors.
    If you get a blister: DO NOT POP it. If popped, increases chances of bacterial infection. Cover infected area with moleskin.
    TO DRAIN: Wash skin with soap and water, then prick it at the end using a pin you've sterilized over the flame of a match. Press the fluid out and bandage the wound to keep it clean.</p2>

<div>MINOR BURNS OR SCALDS</div>

<p3>First Degree:1st degree burns are superficial burns and are caused by touching hot items. There is a painful reddening of the skin and the burn is only on the outer layer of skin. Allow the burn to dry, then cover loosely with sterile gauze pad and bandage.</p3>
<div>2nd degree burns affect the outer layer of skin and part of the layer below it. These burns develop redness and blistering of the skin. These are caused by scalding from boiling liquids. Treatment: follow the same steps for a 1st degree burn, however the victim may choose to seek medical attention when he/she can.</div>
<div>3rd degree burns are also called full-thickness burns and these are serious and possibly life threatening. These are caused by being exposed to open flames, electricity, or chemicals creating such a burn. The skin may be burned away and the flesh charred. If nerves are damaged, the victim may not feel any pain.</div>

<p4>BITES AND STINGS OF INSECTS AND TICKS</p4>

<div>Ticks:</div>

<div>When removing a tick from a person's skin, graph the tick with tweezers.</div>
<div>Get as close to the skin as possible and pull slowly and steadily.</div>
<div>Ensure that the head of the tick is removed from the skin.</div>

<div>Spiders:</div>

<div>Call 911 or the local emergency number.</div>
<div>Wash the wound thoroughly.</div>
<div>Apply an antibiotic ointment and bandage the wound.</div>
<div>An ice pack can be applied to reduce the pain and swelling.</div>
<div>Keep the bitten area elevated.</div>

<div>Insect Stings:</div>
<div>Remove any visible stinger by scraping it away from the skin with a plastic card. Tweezers can also be used (be sure to grasp the stinger and the the venom sac).</div>
<div>Wash the site with soap and water.</div>
<div>Cover the injury and keep it clean.</div>
<div>A cold pack can be applied to reduce pain and swelling.</div>
<div>Call 911 or the local emergency number if the person has trouble breathing or if signs of anaphylactic shock is present.</div>

<p5>SNAKEBITES</p5>

<div>Call 911 or the local emergency number if the bite is from a venomous snake.</div>
<div>Wash the wound and apply an elastic bandage to slow the spread of venom (fingers must not be able to easily be pushed in between the band and the skin.</div>
<div>Keep the injured area lower than the heart.</div>
<div>Do not apply ice. Do not cut the wound. Do not apply suction. Do not apply a tourniquet.</div>

<p6>NOSEBLEEDS</p6>

<div>Use your thumb and index finger to pinch your nostrils shut. Breathe through your mouth. Continue to pinch for five to 10 minutes. Pinching sends pressure to the bleeding point on the nasal septum and often stops the flow of blood.</div>

<p7>FROSTBITE</p7>

<div>Page 125-150 closer to 140. I can't do this while making sure my sandwich doesn't fall and holding my book open.</div>
